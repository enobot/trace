## General Info:

This is my first (solo) personal mobile project using React Native. I came up with the idea when my kitten ran away and she wasn't microchipped at the time. Trace works for pet owners, bystanders, law enforcements, and also shelter workers / animal control.

How it works for pet owners:

- If a pet owner notices that their pet had ran away, the owner can open the app and pinpoint the very last seen location of their pet on Google Maps

  - The owner can then leave a short description of color / breed / name of said pet and will mark the pet as "Missing"
  - The owner can also using the SEARCH option and Trace will display a radius of missing pets that have been marked as "Seen" by bystanders
    - When using the SEARCH option, the owner can select filters for colors / breeds last seen and can select how far back the "Seen" results show
  - The owner can also check if local shelters / police stations have seen such lost pets

- If a bystander sees a lost animal, they can pinpoint the last seen location of the animal on google maps
  - Just like an owner, a bystander can also check if pets are marked as "Missing" and if the bystander sees a pet that is similar to the one that is marked as missing, the bystander can anonynmously connect with the owner that had put up the missing pet alert.
